# CLI guide

`windbg-tool.exe` can act as a local discovery tool, a daemon-backed TTD client, a DbgEng helper, and a WinDbg launcher/updater.

## How the CLI is organized

- **Discovery commands** do not require the daemon: `discover`, `cli-schema`, `recipes`, `tools`, `schema`, `trace-list`, `symbols inspect`
- **Replay commands** usually talk to the local daemon and operate on a `session_id` and `cursor_id`
- **Recording commands** use the separately installed Microsoft `TTD.exe` recorder and do not require the daemon
- **Canonical agent debugging commands** start with `debug`, `triage`, `symbols doctor`, and `breakpoint plan`
- **Platform helper commands** cover DbgEng, remote debugging doctors/plans, live-launch probing, and WinDbg installation

## Common replay workflow

Start or reuse the local daemon:

```powershell
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe daemon ensure
```

Open a trace and create a cursor in one step:

```powershell
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe open C:\path\to\trace.run --binary-path C:\path\to\binary.exe
```

Rediscover active sessions and cursors later:

```powershell
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe sessions
```

Use the returned handles with analysis commands:

```powershell
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe info --session 1
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe debug snapshot --session 1 --cursor 1
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe position set --session 1 --cursor 1 --position 50
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe exception focus --session 1 --cursor 1 --index 0
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe registers --session 1 --cursor 1
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe disasm --session 1 --cursor 1
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe memory strings --session 1 --cursor 1 --address 0x12345678 --size 256 --encoding both
```

`open` is the preferred starting point because it loads the trace, creates a cursor, and optionally seeks to a position in one response. `debug snapshot` is the canonical cross-backend snapshot for agents; `context snapshot` remains available as the legacy TTD-focused snapshot.

## Record a trace

`trace record` launches a target with the Microsoft `TTD.exe` command-line recorder, waits for it to exit, and emits the resulting `.run` path. It uses TTD's documented `-noUI -out <path> -launch <target command line>` invocation; the target command line is passed directly, not through a shell. Because TTD recording requires elevation, it runs TTD directly from an elevated terminal or automatically invokes Windows 11 `sudo` when it is configured for the synchronous **Input Closed** or **Inline** mode. Force New Window mode is rejected because it returns before the recorder completes.

Install the standalone TTD recorder with `winget install --id Microsoft.TimeTravelDebugging`, then open a new elevated terminal so `ttd.exe` is on `PATH`. You can also set `TTD_EXE` or pass `--ttd-exe`. `trace record` always passes TTD's `-accepteula` option.

```powershell
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact trace record `
  --output C:\traces\rdm.run `
  --command-line '"C:\apps\RemoteDesktopManager.exe" /AutoCloseAfter:10'
```

The output directory must already exist and the `.run` path must not already exist. TTD traces include process-memory data and should be handled as sensitive artifacts.

For high-overhead startup captures, first choose a bounded capture strategy:

```powershell
# Preserve the earliest startup data, up to 1 GiB.
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe trace record --profile startup `
  --output C:\traces\rdm-startup.run `
  --command-line '"C:\apps\RemoteDesktopManager.exe" /AutoCloseAfter:10'

# Retain only the newest data in a 2 GiB rolling window.
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe trace record --profile recent `
  --output C:\traces\rdm-recent.run `
  --command-line '"C:\apps\RemoteDesktopManager.exe" /AutoCloseAfter:10'
```

`--max-file-mb <size>` provides a custom cap; add `--ring` to retain the newest data after the cap is reached. `--profile` is a convenience preset and cannot be combined with either custom size option.

Use repeatable `--module <basename>` to ask TTD to record only selected native modules, for example `--module RemoteDesktopManager_x64.exe --module coreclr.dll`. The values must be basenames, not paths. Module filtering is an experiment: managed code often executes as JIT-generated code associated with `coreclr.dll`, so filtering only the application executable can omit needed behavior.

`--replay-cpu-support <default|most-aggressive|...>` forwards TTD's replay CPU compatibility setting. `--num-vcpu <count>` can reduce recorder memory pressure, but TTD warns that lowering it can severely slow recording; do not use it as a performance optimization.

If TTD reports that the target has CET shadow stacks enabled, use `--disable-user-shadow-stack` to launch only that new target process with the official Windows process-creation mitigation set to **always off**, then have TTD attach by PID. This is an explicit, per-process compatibility override; it does not change system policy or the target binary. Attaching begins after process creation, so it can miss the earliest startup instructions.

When using that CET-compatible attach mode, `--record-for-seconds <seconds>` asks TTD to stop recording after the requested window without terminating the target. This bounds a hung or slowed startup capture but necessarily retains the attach-mode earliest-startup limitation. After a successful recording, the result includes trace size, elapsed time, output rate, and parsed `.out` sidecar data such as allocated vCPUs, active threads, simulation duration, and finalization state.

To enable synchronous sudo recording, choose **Input Closed** or **Inline** in **Settings > System > Advanced > Enable sudo**, or from an elevated terminal run:

```powershell
sudo config --enable disableInput
```

## Live startup breakpoints

`live startup-break` is a one-shot native DbgEng workflow: by default it launches at the initial debug break, configures one software code breakpoint, continues the target once, waits for a bounded event, captures JSON context, and then ends the debug session. It does not shell out to CDB or WinDbg.

For a development build with DbgEng staged outside the executable directory, set `WINDBG_DBGENG_RUNTIME_DIR` to the matching `dbgeng-runtime` directory. Packaged builds load the matching DbgEng runtime copied beside `windbg-tool.exe`; both paths use a process-local, dependency-safe loader.

Use a module basename and RVA when the executable is present at the initial break:

```powershell
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact live startup-break `
  --command-line '"C:\Temp\windbg-tool-ttd\rdm\RemoteDesktopManager_x64.exe" /AutoCloseAfter:10' `
  --module RemoteDesktopManager_x64.exe `
  --module-offset 0x1000 `
  --wait-timeout-ms 10000 `
  --end terminate
```

Alternatively specify an absolute `--address`, or a deferred DbgEng `--symbol 'module!symbol'` expression. Deferred symbol breakpoints allow module and symbol loading after process creation. The response includes the initial event, configured breakpoint, an explicit `breakpoint.hit` evidence flag, PID/thread/IP, current module and symbol, core registers, and a bounded stack. A stopped event that does not match the configured breakpoint remains reported as `hit: false`; it is not misrepresented as a breakpoint hit.

Use `--initial-break` when no reliable code breakpoint is available or the host policy rejects breakpoint creation. It captures the initial DbgEng process break without continuing the target and labels that evidence explicitly; it does not claim a code-breakpoint hit.

`--end terminate` is the default for disposable startup probes. Use `--end detach` only when the debuggee should continue after the captured event.

### Non-invasive processor execute breakpoint

`--hardware-execute` switches `live startup-break` to a DbgEng processor breakpoint. It starts from a create-process event (not a software initial break), waits for the requested native module-load event, then creates `DEBUG_BREAKPOINT_DATA` with `DEBUG_BREAK_EXECUTE` and byte size `1`. It does not open the DAC, request CLR notifications, or place a software breakpoint byte in target memory.

The .NET 10.0.9 x64 fixture verified this path against CoreCLR's `coreclr_execute_assembly` export (RVA `0x2F690` for that runtime):

```powershell
$fixture = Resolve-Path crates\windbg-tool\tests\fixtures\ManagedBreakpointFixture
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact live startup-break `
  --command-line "`"$fixture\bin\Release\net10.0\win-x64\ManagedBreakpointFixture.exe`"" `
  --wait-for-module coreclr.dll `
  --module coreclr.dll --module-offset 0x2F690 `
  --hardware-execute --initial-break-timeout-ms 30000 --wait-timeout-ms 30000 `
  --end terminate
```

Use `symbols exports <coreclr.dll> --filter coreclr_execute_assembly` to obtain the RVA for a different CoreCLR version. The validated response had `breakpoint_mode: "hardware_execute"`, `configured.break_type: 1`, `configured.data_access_type: 4`, `configured.data_size: 1`, `configured.match_thread: null`, `configured.id: 0`, and `hit: true`. DbgEng then reported breakpoint ID `0` at `coreclr!coreclr_execute_assembly` with the current instruction pointer equal to the configured address. This is a verified **native** processor-breakpoint hit, not a managed-method hit.

Processor breakpoints are a constrained CPU resource. [Microsoft's processor-breakpoint documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/processor-breakpoints---ba-breakpoints-) distinguishes them from software breakpoints and permits execute access on code. On x64, DR0 through DR3 provide only four address-register slots per thread context; existing debugger or target users can reduce usable capacity. DbgEng supports an engine-thread filter through [`IDebugBreakpoint2::SetMatchThreadId`](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgeng/nf-dbgeng-idebugbreakpoint2-setmatchthreadid), but this one-shot command deliberately leaves it unset (`match_thread: null`), so any target thread may trigger the breakpoint. A thread filter would not create additional hardware-register capacity.

## Managed CoreCLR DAC breakpoints

`live managed-break` does not load SOS or execute `!bpmd`. It starts with a DbgEng create-process event, stops on CoreCLR and the requested managed module load, dynamically loads the exact x64 `mscordaccore.dll` that is a sibling of the target's loaded `coreclr.dll`, resolves the selected `MethodDef` through the DAC, requests CLR code-generation notification, then creates a DbgEng **code** breakpoint at the DAC-mapped native entry. `managed_breakpoint.hit` is true only when both the DbgEng breakpoint ID and current instruction pointer match that DAC-mapped address.

Build and stage `windbg_coreclr_dac_bridge.dll` with `cargo xtask native-build`; `cargo xtask package` places it beside `windbg-tool.exe`. A development build can set `WINDBG_CORECLR_DAC_BRIDGE_DLL` to the bridge DLL. The target DAC is never bundled: it must exactly match the target CoreCLR architecture and file version.

CLR's notification mechanism writes debugger-notification state into the target. The DAC first requests a small JIT-notification table through `ICLRDataTarget2::AllocVirtual`; the bridge obtains the active target process handle from DbgEng and calls `VirtualAllocEx` only for that CLR-owned allocation. DbgEng then applies its normal code-breakpoint byte at the resolved entry. Therefore `--allow-runtime-write` is explicit and should be used only in an approved test VM. Without it the command fails clearly before any target allocation or write; it does not disable endpoint protection, hollow the process, or silently fall back to SOS.

The bridge resolves metadata through `IXCLRDataMethodDefinition`, then uses the matching `IXCLRDataMethodInstance` after CLR code-generation notification. A definition's representative address is IL, not executable code; the code breakpoint always uses the instance's JIT-native entry address.

### Read-only managed hardware mode

`live managed-break --hardware-execute` is a separate, deliberately restricted path. It is mutually exclusive with `--allow-runtime-write` and performs only a read-only DAC query plus a DbgEng processor execute breakpoint when a native method instance is already available. It does not request module/code notifications, allocate CLR notification state, use `WriteVirtual` or `VirtualAllocEx`, create a software code breakpoint, use SOS, inject code, or force JIT compilation.

The command starts from create-process and native module-load events. It resolves exact private/overload metadata only if CoreCLR has already registered the requested module with the DAC at the native image-load stop. If the selected method already has a native instance, it uses a one-byte `DEBUG_BREAK_EXECUTE` breakpoint at that exact DAC-native address and reports a hit only when DbgEng's breakpoint ID and current instruction pointer both match.

The safe .NET 10.0.9 x64 fixture established that the native `ManagedBreakpointFixture.dll` load event occurs before the module is visible to the read-only DAC. This invocation therefore correctly returned `managed_breakpoint.binding_state: "module_not_observable_without_runtime_write"` and `hit: false`:

```powershell
$env:WINDBG_CORECLR_DAC_BRIDGE_DLL = `
  (Resolve-Path target\native\coreclr-dac-bridge\bin\Release\windbg_coreclr_dac_bridge.dll)
$fixture = Resolve-Path crates\windbg-tool\tests\fixtures\ManagedBreakpointFixture
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact live managed-break `
  --command-line "`"$fixture\bin\Release\net10.0\win-x64\ManagedBreakpointFixture.exe`"" `
  --managed-module ManagedBreakpointFixture.dll `
  --method ManagedBreakpointFixture.ManagedTargets.PrivateEntry `
  --hardware-execute --initial-break-timeout-ms 30000 --wait-timeout-ms 30000 `
  --end terminate
```

This is an intentional non-hit, not a fallback failure: the tool leaves the process at the module-load stop, then ends the session according to `--end`, rather than continuing to wait for JIT or mutating CLR state. Consequently, the current non-invasive mode cannot prove a private managed-method hit. A later JIT event, tiered recompilation, ReadyToRun indirection, re-JIT, generic instantiation, or unload can create or replace the native entry, and the read-only path has no supported event that tracks those transitions. The verified native `coreclr!coreclr_execute_assembly` hit above does not establish managed-method semantics.

```powershell
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact live managed-break `
  --command-line '"C:\apps\RemoteDesktopManager_x64.exe" /AutoCloseAfter:10' `
  --managed-module RemoteDesktopManager.dll `
  --method Devolutions.RemoteDesktopManager.Program.Main `
  --allow-runtime-write `
  --end terminate
```

The vertical slice resolves regular private methods as normal metadata. An unambiguous fully-qualified metadata name needs no additional selector. For overloads, pass `--signature` with the exact ECMA-335 `MethodDef` signature blob as hexadecimal byte pairs; whitespace, `-`, `_`, and `:` are accepted only as separators. This is not C# syntax. For example, a static `string Overload(string)` method has the blob `00010E0E` (`DEFAULT`, one parameter, `STRING` return, `STRING` parameter), while `string Overload()` is `00000E`. The response reports the selected `signature_hex`, every bounded name-matching candidate's token/signature, and whether candidate output was truncated. C# signatures, generic instantiations, ReadyToRun indirection, tiered recompilation, re-JIT, and unload transitions remain explicit limits.

### Managed breakpoint fixture

`crates\windbg-tool\tests\fixtures\ManagedBreakpointFixture` is a source-only .NET 10 x64 fixture with deterministic no-inline public, private, and overload targets. Its generated `bin` and `obj` directories are ignored. Build it, then run one command per target in an approved test VM:

```powershell
$fixture = Resolve-Path crates\windbg-tool\tests\fixtures\ManagedBreakpointFixture
dotnet build "$fixture\ManagedBreakpointFixture.csproj" -c Release

target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact live managed-break `
  --command-line "`"$fixture\bin\Release\net10.0\win-x64\ManagedBreakpointFixture.exe`"" `
  --managed-module ManagedBreakpointFixture.dll `
  --method ManagedBreakpointFixture.ManagedTargets.PublicEntry `
  --allow-runtime-write --end terminate

target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact live managed-break `
  --command-line "`"$fixture\bin\Release\net10.0\win-x64\ManagedBreakpointFixture.exe`"" `
  --managed-module ManagedBreakpointFixture.dll `
  --method ManagedBreakpointFixture.ManagedTargets.PrivateEntry `
  --allow-runtime-write --end terminate

target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact live managed-break `
  --command-line "`"$fixture\bin\Release\net10.0\win-x64\ManagedBreakpointFixture.exe`"" `
  --managed-module ManagedBreakpointFixture.dll `
  --method ManagedBreakpointFixture.ManagedTargets.Overload `
  --signature 00010E0E `
  --allow-runtime-write --end terminate
```

The last command selects `Overload(string)` rather than `Overload()`. A valid result has `managed_breakpoint.hit: true`, a DbgEng breakpoint ID/current instruction pointer equal to `code_generation.representative_native_entry_address`, and `managed_resolution.method_after_code_generation.token`/`signature_hex` identifying the selected `MethodDef`.

The .NET 10.0.9 x64 fixture was validated with the direct DAC bridge:

| Target | Token | Signature | Hit evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ManagedTargets.PublicEntry()` | `100663298` | `00000E` | `hit: true`; breakpoint ID `0` and IP matched its native entry |
| private `ManagedTargets.PrivateEntry()` | `100663300` | `00000E` | `hit: true`; breakpoint ID `0` and IP matched its native entry |
| `ManagedTargets.Overload(string)` | `100663302` | `00010E0E` | `hit: true`; breakpoint ID `0`, IP matched native entry, and the selected candidates were `0x06000005:00000E` and `0x06000006:00010E0E` |

## Non-invasive live startup profiling

`live startup-profile` is a one-shot DbgEng lifecycle collector for agent-oriented startup evidence. It launches at a DbgEng `create_process` event, enables only create/exit-process, create/exit-thread, load/unload-module event filters, then resumes the target and records bounded stopped events. It does **not** configure a software or hardware breakpoint, open the DAC, request CLR notifications, allocate or write target memory, inject code, or use a profiler.

The default exception policy does not request first-chance exceptions because managed startup can produce enough expected exceptions to consume the bounded timeline. Use `--include-first-chance-exceptions` only when that additional event volume is justified.

`--capture-debuggee-output` is an opt-in, host-side DbgEng `IDebugOutputCallbacksWide` capture for only the debuggee and debuggee-prompt categories. It is disabled by default because debug strings can contain sensitive content. `--max-output-records`, `--max-output-chars`, and `--max-total-output-chars` independently bound retained records and text; `debuggee_output` reports truncation/drop counts and restores the prior callback and output mask before the run ends. A record's `preceding_event_index` is the latest retained lifecycle event when DbgEng invoked the callback, not a causal association.

The command reports two host-monotonic measures:

- `command_to_create_observed_ms` is the wall time from before DbgEng session creation until windbg-tool observes the create-process event.
- Timeline `resumed_wall_elapsed_ms` and derived `phase_durations` accumulate only while the target is resumed between observed DbgEng stops. This excludes the collector's intentionally stopped filter/configuration/context work, but includes DbgEng scheduling and event-delivery latency.

Neither measure is target CPU time. A module-load timestamp does not identify managed registration, JIT work, or method execution. Repeated runs report min/median/max wall time only for phases whose two event boundaries were observed in runs that reached the requested completion condition; no baseline means the output deliberately does not call a value a regression.

Build and profile the source-only fixture without any DAC or breakpoint workflow:

```powershell
$fixture = Resolve-Path crates\windbg-tool\tests\fixtures\ManagedBreakpointFixture
dotnet build "$fixture\ManagedBreakpointFixture.csproj" -c Release
$report = Join-Path $env:TEMP "windbg-tool-fixture-startup-profile.json"

target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact live startup-profile `
  --command-line "`"$fixture\bin\Release\net10.0\win-x64\ManagedBreakpointFixture.exe`" --startup-observation-delay-ms 2000" `
  --phase-module ManagedBreakpointFixture.dll `
  --completion-module ManagedBreakpointFixture.dll `
  --settle-ms 250 `
  --initial-break-timeout-ms 30000 `
  --timeout-ms 30000 `
  --max-events 256 `
  --output $report
```

`--completion-module <basename>` ends an observation at the matching DbgEng image-load event. It is an image-load boundary only: it is not UI-ready, managed registration, JIT completion, or application initialization. Add `--settle-ms 1..60000` to require a target-resumed interval without a further configured lifecycle stop after that load. Any observed lifecycle stop restarts the interval. A `quiet_interval_observed` result establishes only that bounded DbgEng condition; it does not prove target quiescence, CPU idleness, I/O completion, or UI readiness. If process exit, timeout, or the event limit occurs first, the result stays incomplete and never infers quietness.

`--max-events` bounds retained timeline payload rather than forcing a healthy target to terminate. For a full-lifetime profile without `--completion-module`, windbg-tool retains `max_events - 1` entries, disables high-volume thread/module filters, and waits only for `exit_process`, preserving the final exit boundary in the last slot. The result marks this as `coverage.timeline_truncated: true` and lists the DbgEng `timing.tail_filter_commands`; it makes no claim about events omitted during that exit-only tail. A completion-bound profile instead stops as incomplete at its retention limit, because disabling the lifecycle filters would make a quiet interval unknowable. A single completion-bound run defaults to `--end detach`, so the target can finish normally. Repeated runs require the explicit `--end terminate` cleanup mode to prevent overlapping detached targets. A full-lifetime successful run has `finish_reason: "exit_process"`; a module completion has `finish_reason: "completion_module"`; a quiet completion has `finish_reason: "completion_module_quiet_interval"`.

The opt-in `--capture-stop-context` captures bounded read-only register/module/symbol/stack context on selected early stops; it can increase observer overhead and is disabled by default. `--context-on` selects event kinds, defaulting to `load-module`, `create-thread`, `exception`, and `exit-process`; every timeline event has an explicit context status (`not_requested`, `not_selected`, `limit_reached`, `captured`, or `unavailable`). `--capture-module-provenance` separately reads bounded host-file metadata only for absolute module image paths DbgEng already observed. Its records include canonical host path, file size/last-write time, PE architecture/image timestamp, CodeView identity, and available Win32 file/product versions. This is host-file metadata, not target-memory evidence or lifecycle timing; it never hashes, verifies signatures, or reads an unobserved path.

Compare independent artifacts with no debugger launch or target interaction:

```powershell
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact live startup-compare `
  --baseline $baselineReport `
  --candidate $candidateReport `
  --max-sequence-events 64
```

The comparator accepts only `live_startup_profile` JSON artifacts up to 16 MiB. It compares observed phase and one-largest-gap wall-time distributions plus bounded lifecycle event/module/exception sequence prefixes. It reports profile and comparison truncation, omits unstable thread IDs, and never labels a difference as a CPU regression or causal explanation.

For a future RDM observation, use the bounded no-breakpoint form only after the fixture command has completed with the expected no-write report:

```powershell
$rdm = 'D:\dev\.copilot\copilot-worktrees\RDM\bookish-winner\Windows\RemoteDesktopManager\Program\bin\Release\net10.0-windows10.0.19041\RemoteDesktopManager_x64.exe'
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact live startup-profile `
  --command-line "`"$rdm`" /AutoCloseAfter:30" `
  --phase-module RemoteDesktopManager.dll `
  --completion-module RemoteDesktopManager.dll `
  --settle-ms 500 `
  --initial-break-timeout-ms 30000 `
  --timeout-ms 30000 `
  --max-events 512 `
  --output (Join-Path $env:TEMP "windbg-tool-rdm-startup-quiet.json")
```

The default detach is intentional for this one completion-bound RDM observation. For a bounded repeated image-load distribution after that initial result, omit `--settle-ms` and use explicit cleanup:

```powershell
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact live startup-profile `
  --command-line "`"$rdm`" /AutoCloseAfter:30" `
  --runs 3 `
  --phase-module RemoteDesktopManager.dll `
  --completion-module RemoteDesktopManager.dll `
  --initial-break-timeout-ms 30000 `
  --timeout-ms 30000 `
  --max-events 128 `
  --end terminate `
  --output (Join-Path $env:TEMP "windbg-tool-rdm-startup-module-runs-3.json")
```

`--end terminate` is explicit cleanup for that repeated command, not a startup boundary or a measurement result. Do not add `live startup-break`, `live managed-break`, DAC options, or an endpoint-security workaround to either RDM command. If the initial safe-mode RDM run is blocked or fails, retain its DbgEng error/event evidence and stop rather than retrying or changing protection policy.

### Observed local RDM lifecycle evidence

The local Release x64 RDM build completed an event-only completion-bound profile with `target_memory_writes.requested: false`, zero structured DbgEng exception stops, and no synthetic `unknown` events. The first single run saw `coreclr.dll` at resumed-wall 438 ms, `RemoteDesktopManager.dll` at 517 ms, later lifecycle events through 534 ms, then an observed 508 ms lifecycle-quiet interval. It detached rather than observing process exit; this is not a UI-ready signal.

The bounded three-run module-boundary collection used explicit `--end terminate` cleanup after each `completion_module` result. It did not observe process exit, so post-module lifetime is intentionally unavailable:

| Observable host-wall phase | Min ms | Median ms | Max ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| command start to create-process observation | 5 | 5 | 178 |
| create-process to `coreclr.dll` load | 423 | 426 | 427 |
| `coreclr.dll` load to `RemoteDesktopManager.dll` load | 32 | 33 | 34 |
| `hostpolicy.dll` load to `coreclr.dll` load (largest adjacent observed gap) | 189 | 191 | 192 |

The RDM image-load boundary occurred at event index 34 in every repeated sample. A separate 500 ms quiet-bound run reached its 256-event limit after post-module UI/graphics-related loader activity, correctly reporting incomplete rather than claiming startup completion. These are observer wall-clock lifecycle intervals, not CPU samples or proof that a specific RDM phase consumed CPU. The largest gap is a follow-up wall-time investigation candidate only.

### Verified RDM x64 test-VM run

The approved .NET 10.0.9 x64 test VM used this direct, no-SOS invocation:

```powershell
$root = 'C:\Users\Public\windbg-tool-rdm-dac-24dd653'
$env:WINDBG_DBGENG_RUNTIME_DIR = "$root\tool"
$env:WINDBG_CORECLR_DAC_BRIDGE_DLL = "$root\tool\windbg_coreclr_dac_bridge.dll"

& "$root\tool\windbg-tool.exe" --compact live managed-break `
  --command-line "`"$root\rdm\RemoteDesktopManager_x64.exe`" /AutoCloseAfter:60" `
  --managed-module RemoteDesktopManager.dll `
  --method Devolutions.RemoteDesktopManager.Program.Main `
  --allow-runtime-write --initial-break-timeout-ms 30000 --wait-timeout-ms 120000 --end terminate
```

That run reported `workflow: "live_managed_break_dac"`, a matching CoreCLR/DAC file version, `managed_resolution.method_after_code_generation.token: 100663305`, `representative_entry_address: 0x7FFC8ABDA8A0`, and `managed_breakpoint: { kind: "software_code", configured.id: 0, hit: true }`. The final context had `instruction_pointer: 0x7FFC8ABDA8A0` and `current_symbol: RemoteDesktopManager!Devolutions.RemoteDesktopManager.Program.Main(System.String[])`.

The same command with `--method Devolutions.RemoteDesktopManager.Program.ApplyDpiAwarness` proved a private method without reflection or SOS: token `100663306`, native entry and final instruction pointer `0x7FFC8AC09920`, breakpoint ID `0`, and final symbol `RemoteDesktopManager!Devolutions.RemoteDesktopManager.Program.ApplyDpiAwarness()`.

### RDM approval requirement

The prior RDM evidence above was collected in an approved test VM. RDM remains blocked for breakpoint and DAC workflows: do not launch, resume, or attach it under software or hardware breakpoints, CLR notifications, or target-memory writes, and do not seek an exclusion or workaround. The separate `live startup-profile` flow above is limited to lifecycle-event filters and has no target-memory operation; it may be attempted once under the current profiling policy after fixture validation. If that safe mode is blocked, stop rather than retrying. Any future breakpoint/DAC RDM proof requires a new explicit direction plus written approval from the application owner and endpoint-security owner for the designated test VM and RDM build. That approval must state the allowed debugger operations; it does not authorize disabling, weakening, bypassing, or otherwise altering Sophos, HitmanPro.Alert, or RDM protections.

## AI-oriented DbgEng target inspection

Daemon-owned live and dump targets expose bounded, read-only inspection commands for agent workflows. After `target wait` reports a stop on a live target, use `target event` to identify the DbgEng event that caused it. The response includes the process/thread IDs, event type, and, where DbgEng provides it, a breakpoint ID, exception code/address/first-chance state, module base, or exit code. It does not return unbounded debugger output. Event inspection is unavailable for dump targets because a dump has no live event stream.

```powershell
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact target event --target 1
```

`target threads` returns DbgEng engine thread IDs. Use one of those IDs with `target thread` to capture that thread's core registers, nearest module/symbol, bounded stack, and bounded disassembly. The command restores the previously selected DbgEng thread before returning, so it is safe for agents to inspect worker threads without changing subsequent target commands.

```powershell
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact target threads --target 1
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact target thread --target 1 `
  --engine-thread-id 3 --max-frames 16 --disassembly-count 8
```

`debug snapshot --target <id>` now includes a best-effort `event` section by default for live targets. Use `--exclude event` when an event query is not relevant, or `--include event` to request it alone.

`target memory-map --target <id> --region-limit <1..4096>` and MCP `target_memory_map` query the stopped live user-mode target through `IDebugDataSpaces4::QueryVirtual`; both enforce the same `1..4096` region bound. They do not parse extension output or call `VirtualQueryEx`. The result uses numeric `MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION64` fields with `source: "dbgeng_idata_spaces4_query_virtual"`. `status: "bounded"` and `truncated: true` mean the region cap was reached, while `unavailable` or `partial_query_error` explicitly mean that full address-space coverage is not claimed. It is unavailable for dump targets.

## Canonical agent debugging commands

Use `debug capabilities` before choosing actions. With no subject it returns a backend matrix for TTD cursors, daemon-owned live/dump targets, and remote process-server plans. With `--session/--cursor` or `--target`, it includes selected-subject status/evidence where available.

```powershell
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact debug capabilities
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact debug capabilities --session 1 --cursor 1
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact debug capabilities --target 1
```

Use `debug snapshot` for bounded, sectioned context capture. Each section has independent status, duration, truncation, diagnostics, and the primitive follow-up command. TTD subjects use `--session` and `--cursor`; live or dump subjects use `--target`.

```powershell
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact debug snapshot --session 1 --cursor 1 --include stack --include current_disassembly
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact debug snapshot --target 1 --max-frames 16 --max-modules 32
```

Use `triage <kind>` for evidence plus hypotheses rather than a verdict-only answer:

```powershell
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact triage crash --session 1 --cursor 1
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact triage hang --target 1
```

Use `symbols doctor` and `breakpoint plan` when an agent needs to validate names/source paths or dry-run a mutation:

```powershell
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact symbols doctor --session 1 --cursor 1 --address 0x7ff600001000
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact breakpoint plan --target 1 --address 0x7ff600001000
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact breakpoint plan --session 1 --cursor 1 --address 0x12345678 --kind write --size 8 --direction previous
```

## Remote debugging doctors and plans

`remote doctor`, `remote status`, and `remote plan` are read-only helpers for DbgEng process-server style workflows. TCP connect probing is opt-in because it can be visible to network monitoring.

```powershell
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact remote doctor --transport tcp:port=5005
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact remote status --server target-host --transport tcp:port=5005 --probe-connect --timeout-ms 1000
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact remote plan --server target-host --transport tcp:port=5005
```

## Optional agent action log

Set `WINDBG_TOOL_ACTION_LOG` to append one JSONL entry per CLI invocation. By default entries include only the command path, success status, exit code, and duration; raw arguments are redacted. Set `WINDBG_TOOL_ACTION_LOG_FULL=1` only when full command-line logging is safe for your environment.

```powershell
$env:WINDBG_TOOL_ACTION_LOG = "D:\logs\windbg-tool-actions.jsonl"
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact debug capabilities
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact debug log summarize --path D:\logs\windbg-tool-actions.jsonl
```

## Session and cursor basics

- `session_id` identifies the loaded trace
- `cursor_id` identifies a replay cursor inside that trace
- Many commands accept `-s` for `--session` and `-c` for `--cursor`
- `position set` accepts either a structured position, a WinDbg-style `HEX:HEX` string, or a percentage from `0` to `100`
- `exception focus` accepts a zero-based exception index, seeks with the recorded JSON position and owning TTD thread, and reports a pasteable `requested_position_hex`; use it instead of manually transcribing decimal positions from `exceptions`.
- `timeline events` reports `event_counts` before applying its event limit, and limits source payloads. Its `sources` entries report source status and counts; run `modules`, `events modules`, `events threads`, `exceptions`, or `keyframes` for the full metadata list.

## Output shaping

CLI output is JSON by default. These flags make it easier to script:

- `--compact` for single-line JSON
- `--field <dot.path>` to extract one field
- `--raw` to print scalar values without JSON quotes
- `--envelope` or `WINDBG_TOOL_ENVELOPE=1` to wrap success and failure output in a stable agent contract

Example:

```powershell
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --field session_id --raw open C:\path\to\trace.run
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact registers --session 1 --cursor 1
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact --envelope sessions
```

In envelope mode, successful commands return `{ "schema_version": 1, "ok": true, "data": ... }`. `--field` selects from `data`, so `--envelope --field session_id --raw open ...` still prints the raw session id. Failures return `{ "schema_version": 1, "ok": false, "error": ... }` and ignore `--field`/`--raw` so agents always receive the full error reason.

## Symbol path environment

TTD replay and every DbgEng live-launch, live-attach, and dump session honor the standard Windows symbol environment. Explicit TTD `--symbol-path` values take precedence; otherwise `_NT_SYMBOL_PATH` is searched first, then `_NT_ALT_SYMBOL_PATH`. TTD `--symcache-dir` takes precedence over `_NT_SYMCACHE_PATH`.

If no selected path includes the Microsoft public symbol server, windbg-tool appends `srv*<cache>*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols`. The default cache directories are `.ttd-symbol-cache` for TTD and `.windbg-symbol-cache` for DbgEng. DbgEng target summaries and `live launch` results expose the final `symbol_path`.

Structured error codes use stable exit codes:

| Code | Exit | Retryable |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `invalid_argument` | 2 | false |
| `daemon_unavailable` | 3 | true |
| `daemon_error` | 4 | depends on cause |
| `session_not_found` | 5 | false |
| `cursor_not_found` | 6 | false |
| `timeout` | 7 | true |
| `tool_error` | 8 | depends on cause |
| `internal` | 1 | false |

Daemon connection failures include the selected pipe and a hint to run `windbg-tool daemon ensure`.

## CLI schema discovery

Use `cli-schema` for machine-readable command paths, arguments, possible values, defaults, conflicts, and command metadata:

```powershell
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact cli-schema
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe --compact cli-schema memory read
```

The schema includes curated metadata where available and inferred metadata for other leaf commands. Bounded collection outputs include additive `returned`, `limit`, and `truncated` fields when the command has a fixed result budget.

## Command groups worth learning first

| Goal | Commands |
| --- | --- |
| Discover capabilities | `discover`, `cli-schema [command...]`, `recipes`, `tools`, `schema <tool>` |
| Canonical agent context | `debug capabilities`, `debug snapshot`, `triage <kind>`, `symbols doctor`, `breakpoint plan`, `debug log summarize` |
| Manage daemon/session state | `daemon ensure`, `daemon status`, `sessions`, `open`, `load`, `close`, `info` |
| Capture a new trace | `trace record --output <trace.run> --command-line <target-command-line>` |
| Move through a trace | `cursor create`, `position get`, `position set`, `step`, `replay to`, `replay watch-memory`, `sweep watch-memory` |
| Inspect trace metadata | `threads`, `modules`, `exceptions`, `keyframes`, `timeline events`, `module info`, `module audit` |
| Inspect runtime state | `registers`, `register-context`, `active-threads`, `command-line`, `architecture state` |
| Inspect code and memory | `disasm`, `memory read`, `memory dump`, `memory strings`, `memory dps`, `memory classify`, `memory chase`, `object vtable` |
| Symbol and source triage | `symbols doctor`, `symbols diagnose`, `symbols inspect`, `symbols exports`, `symbols nearest`, `source resolve` |
| WinDbg, live, dump, and remote helpers | `remote explain`, `remote doctor`, `remote status`, `remote plan`, `remote server-command`, `remote connect-command`, `dbgeng server`, `live capabilities`, `live startup-break`, `live startup-profile`, `dump create`, `dump open`, `dump inspect`, `target event`, `target thread`, `target dump`, `windbg status` |

## Useful non-replay commands

These are good starting points even before you have a trace open:

```powershell
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe discover
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe recipes
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe debug capabilities
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe remote doctor --transport tcp:port=5005
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe symbols inspect C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe
target\debug\windbg-tool.exe windbg status
```

## Working with multiple workspaces

Use `--pipe \\.\pipe\windbg-tool-custom` or set `WINDBG_TOOL_PIPE` to isolate concurrent daemon instances. The legacy `TTD_MCP_PIPE` variable is also honored.
